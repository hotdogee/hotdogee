ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Han Lin. As a Research Engineer, I fuse AI, bioinformatics, and electronics to build unique solutions. From designing cutting-edge SCADA/IoT systems that optimize the thermal efficiency of geothermal power plants to developing advanced AI models for protein sequence analysis, I thrive at the intersection of software, hardware, and scientific research.

âœ… With experience spanning sustainable energy, biotech, healthcare, and bioinformatics, I excel at understanding complex requirements and translating them into tangible, high-impact results.

âœ… I grew up in Iowa and am now based in Taiwan; Iâ€™ve worked across diverse environmentsâ€”from the National Agriculture Library in Maryland to leading research initiatives in Taipei. My multicultural background has shaped my collaborative mindset and adaptability.

âœ… I'm passionate about pushing the boundaries of what's possible and am seeking challenging opportunities to contribute to world-class research or groundbreaking engineering projects.

ðŸš€ Letâ€™s build something groundbreaking together!
